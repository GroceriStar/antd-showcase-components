# antd-showcase-components






Showcase is a project where we trying to incorporate two major tasks:
1. show to a new users a collection of grocery lists - before they sign up - they want to explore the data that we have
2. figure out the way about making GL downloable by generating a simple PDF file


Our first goal to create a flexible set of components, that will became a wrapper for any basic project with antd library, that will display our grocery list data.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/GroceriStar/antd-showcase-components.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/GroceriStar/antd-showcase-components)


While we're coding it - we also extending the code base of GS, by testing fetch plugin, by moving away basic components, like lists, grocerylist component, etc...

Major goals for this project are -
* separate an in-development components that we want to use as part of our groceristar project
* make it less confusing and less requiring a lot of attention about keeping in mind what exactly we did before

Stretch goals:
- [ ] install and connect Raven at index.js
- [ ] adjust logic of envconfig and try to connect to our local/shared servers
- [ ] make first axios calls and be happy to receive json results
- [ ] connect to our simple [fake-api](https://github.com/GroceriStar/fake-api) that i've created...
